Roxor provides tools for presenters to gain insight into their audience engagement.  This gives the presenter the ability to improve and react on the fly.  They may review the engagement data to identify areas of weakness.

## Solution ##
We collect real-time participant data to relay to presenters. Data is available for future analysis.
